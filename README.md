# RandomUserGenerator
In this project I have developed a mini-application that makes REST API calls from a React Component to a 3rd party service called RandomUserGenerator API and renders the result into the UI. Iâ€™ve also styled the components using Tailwind CSS, the technology that we would use in our main application.
